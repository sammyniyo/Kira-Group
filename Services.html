                    work together to ensure that a program achieves its intended impact. Regular monitoring allows for
                    adjustments to be made in real time, increasing the likelihood of success. These phases are
                    cyclical, as lessons learned from monitoring can feed back into program design and implementation
                    for continuous improvement.
